        <h1>Stereotypes</h1>
        <h3>The Red Indian Stereotype</h3>
        <p>The Red Indian Stereotype was a belief that the Indigenous were referenced with the colour red, which meant blood and was an insult to their culture. <br>We can see this in play because in this image, it has red as the primary colour.</p>
        <h3>Savage Indian Stereotype</h3>
        <p>There was also another belief that the Indgenous were savage and hunted without mercy. That is untrue, as they valued all life and only hunted<br> what they needed. We can see this in play here as it shows an angry Indigenous (that is, if this person can be classified as Indigenous) holding an axe.</p>
	<h3>Other Stereotypes For This Image</h3>
	<p>Some other stereotypes that are not wide-spread but are in this logo are that the Indigenous had blue-black hair, carried axes, and were white. These are all untrue,<br> as the Indigenous had little to no access to metals until the Europeans came with the Industrial Revolution, they clearly did not have black-blue hair, and they also clearly were not white.</p>
