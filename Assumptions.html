        <h1>Assumptions Made</h1>
        <h3>The Colour Red</h3>
        <p>One assumption in this image is the use of the colour red. This colour is being used as the highlight of <br>the image, which is a reference to the Red Indian Stereotype, and assumes that the Indigenous are savage and covered in blood.</p>
        <h3>Half-Clothed Indigenous</h3>
        <p>Another assumption being made is that the Indigenous are half clothed, as shown in the logo. This assumption is incorrect, as the Indigenous are nearly always properly clothed.</p>
	<h3>Blue-Black haired Indigenous</h3>
	<p>Yet another assumption being made here is that the Indigenous had blue-black hair, seen in the logo. This version of reality is almost always not true, as barely anyone has that hair colour.</p>
	<h3>White Indigenous People</h3>
	<p>The last assumption being made here is that the Indigenous people are white. This is certainly not true, as there would have been quite a <br>bit less racism towards them, and in nearly all photos of the Indigenous it shows them as brown.</p>
