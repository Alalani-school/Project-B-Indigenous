      <h1>What do I think about this image?</h1>
      <p>I think that this image is not a fair representation of the Indigenous, as it portrays the Indigenous as white people who wear feathers and carry axes.<br>This image also uses the Indigenous when there was no need, and has gotten nearly everything about the Indigenous wrong. <br>I think that the Indigenous would not feel happy about this logo at all, seeing as this image of the Indigenous shows them as axe-carrying and <br>basically crazy people, which in my opinion is a very unfair representation of anybody.</p>
