    <h1>
      Indigenous Logo
    </h1>
    <h4>
      The logo I have analyzed is the Stick-Um logo. I choose this logo because it seemed to be different from the rest of the logos, but not in a good way.<br> In this website, there are pages for what colours are being used in the logo, what assumptions are being made in it, what stereotypes associate with it, and what is overal racist within this logo.
